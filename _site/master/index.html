<p>For the upcoming months, I will be working on my <b>master thesis</b> at the <a href="http://www.soz.tu-berlin.de/menue/institut_fuer_soziologie/">Institute of Sociology</a> at the Technical University in Berlin. <a href="https://www.ts.tu-berlin.de/v_menue/mitarbeiter/prof_dr_ingo_schulz_schaeffer/">Prof. Dr. Schulz-Schaeffer</a> is my supervisor. At the moment (October 21st, 2017) I am still assembling a reading list, so I'm in a failry early stage. The sites will fill up gradually.<br>

<p>In my thesis, I want to continue my research on gender and technology with a focus on technology that has been developed in the past years, as a result of diversity efforts and initiatives. My theoretical angle will be the "Social Shaping of Technology" by Judy Wajcman et. al. to take a deeper dive into the question how (diverse) backgrounds are having an impact on the development of technology. Possibly with a glimpse into innovation research.</p> 

<p>If you would like to chat about this topic, I'd be delighted to do so. Please <a href="mailto:fiona@arduina.net">contact me</a>.</p>


<p>This site is hosted and edited on <a href="https://github.com/arduina/arduina.net/tree/gh-pages">github</a>, so feel free to commit and comment. I will not include articles on methods and theoretic approaches that are mainly tools in order to categorize and analyze the findings. They'd probably bore you anyways.</p>
