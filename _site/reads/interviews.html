        <li>Etzkowitz, Henry; Kemelgor, Carol; et. al.:<a href="http://www.kellogg.northwestern.edu/faculty/uzzi/ftp/paradox.pdf">The paradox of Critical Mass of Women in Science</a></li><br>

        * The study inspected 30 different departments in STEM and the dynamics of the "critical mass". It is assumed that the discrete point at which a sufficient number brings about qualitative improvement and accelerates the change lies at 15%. This change has to be supported by outside intervention and assitance. Change agents can stem from the marginalized or the majority group.<br> 
        Though attainment of critical mass doesn't solve the problem all by itself, since women pursue different strategies themselves and could be isolated in smaller research groups or subfield fragmentation. The differentiation of female faculty prodces isolation even when the numbers reach critical mass.<br>
        Furthermore women chose different strategies - women who are following a "male model" or "relational female model" can pose a great challenge. They either lack the provision of a model that successfully combines family and academia or they pose much higher demands towards women, based on the assumption that women are constantly underestimated. This can result in a goals too high for some women to achieve, consequently being debilitating. 
        Another hurdle can be the deniance of women towards gender-related discrimination out of fear of stigmatization. Without role models, women are less willing to attempt carreeers in academic science.<br>
        Hence it is not only the sheer number of women faculty members, but a conduit of information about negotiating the social structure of science, is crucial. There is a great need to address isolation at the highest levels of academic policy. Programs and policies regarding child care and parental leave are a key factor in overcoming the significant high number of women dropping out at transition points. Also, tokeism must be eschweded, when some female stars are aggressively courted, but others still languish in discrimination.<br>
        Connecting female members of academia and outside pressure, like decisions on grants, are essential. Participation of all groups in society is a basis for the public support for science and its legitimation. It is in everybodys interest to not waste on potential and utilizing talent to its fullest extent.<br>
