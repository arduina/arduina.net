<p>For the upcoming months, I will be working on my <b>bachelor thesis</b> and therefore I am conducting research on factors that affect <b>women's inclination to join or stay away from tech and tech communites</b>. The field has to remain rather broad for right now, but I will go more into detail as soon as I have passed the orientation phase. If you want to talk about this topic, I'd be delighted to do so. Please <a href="mailto:fiona@arduina.net">contact me</a>.</p>

<p>I will gather the articles that I am reading online in the following list with comments. This site is hostet and edited on <a href="https://github.com/arduina/arduina.net">github</a>, so feel free to commit and comment.</p>

<p>Thanks to the people who have suggested ideas and links, e.g. <a href="http://twitter.com/zararah">Zara</a>. The list of people to thank for is certainly going to grow.</p>

            3 female scientists from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology opened an AMA (Ask me Anything) thread on reddit and the Internet was pretty Internet about it. Originally the scientists wanted to address issues that affect women in STEM, exchange with others, talk about how they got into the topic. But the most frequent reaction was "Why would you put your gender in the AMA anyways?" which works great as a qed. Because it matters.</li>
