<p>For the upcoming months, I will be working on my <b>bachelor thesis</b>. I want to examine the practices of individuals and initiatives that are striving towards integrating women in programming and computer science. The focus lies on the actors and their (differing) strategies in pursuing their goals and hence their practices. Qualitative Interviews are my main method, the analysis will be done with grounded theory. I will also visit Events and conduct research with some participatory observation. The research is underminded by studies and scholarly articles from History, Social Psychology, Sociology, Economics, Gender Studies and other disciplines. Non-scholarly articles and interviews are also part of the research body. If you want to exchange about this topic, I'd be delighted to do so. Please <a href="mailto:fiona@arduina.net">contact me</a>.</p>

<p>I will gather the articles that I am reading online in the following list with comments. This site is hosted and edited on <a href="https://github.com/arduina/arduina.net">github</a>, so feel free to commit and comment. I will not include articles on methods and theoretic approaches that are mainly tools in order to categorize and analyze the findings. They'd probably bore you.</p>

<p>Thanks to the people who have suggested ideas and links.</p>

<p>Also I'd like to state that this <a href="http://femalesoftwareeng.tumblr.com">tumblr</a> on being a female software engineer is fucking hilarious.</p>

        <li>Etzkowitz, Henry; Kemelgor, Carol; et. al.:<a href="http://www.kellogg.northwestern.edu/faculty/uzzi/ftp/paradox.pdf">The paradox of Critical Mass of Women in Science</a></li><br>

        * The study inspected 30 different departments in STEM and the dynamics of the "critical mass". It is assumed that the discrete point at which a sufficient number brings about qualitative improvement and accelerates the change lies at 15%. This change has to be supported by outside intervention and assistance. Change agents can stem from the marginalized or the majority group.<br> 
        Though attainment of critical mass doesn't solve the problem all by itself, since women pursue different strategies themselves and could be isolated in smaller research groups or subfield fragmentation. The differentiation of female faculty produces isolation even when the numbers reach critical mass.<br>
        Furthermore women chose different strategies - women who are following a "male model" or "relational female model" can pose a great challenge. They either lack the provision of a model that successfully combines family and academia or they pose much higher demands towards women, based on the assumption that women are constantly underestimated. This can result in a goals too high for some women to achieve, consequently being debilitating. 
        Another hurdle can be the deniance of women towards gender-related discrimination out of fear of stigmatization. Without role models, women are less willing to attempt carreeers in academic science.<br>
        Hence it is not only the sheer number of women faculty members, but a conduit of information about negotiating the social structure of science, is crucial. There is a great need to address isolation at the highest levels of academic policy. Programs and policies regarding child care and parental leave are a key factor in overcoming the significant high number of women dropping out at transition points. Also, tokeism must be eschweded, when some female stars are aggressively courted, but others still languish in discrimination.<br>
        Connecting female members of academia and outside pressure, like decisions on grants, are essential. Participation of all groups in society is a basis for the public support for science and its legitimation. It is in everybodys interest to not waste on potential and utilizing talent to its fullest extent.<br><br> 

        <li>Camp, Tracy: <a href="https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~women/resources/aroundTheWeb/hostedPapers/Syllabus-Camp.pdf">Women in Computer Sciences: Reversing the trend.</a></li><br>

        * Camp states: "To create better computing technology, computing development teams need to have different perspectives, different points of view and different approaches to problem solving.[...] While men usually focus on the computer and its technology, women most often focus on what the computer can do for socienty. Bringing these divergend personalities and abilities to the table creates better products, a fact that industry now realizes"<br>
        To tackle the trend of decreasing female degree holders in computer science, Camp suggest several approaches, that are incumbent to academia:<br>
        - Locate women as speakers, esp. as keynote speakers<br>
        - encourage women to participate in online computing communities for women, like systers.org <br>
        - provide support for attending conferences<br>
        - install a mentoring program for women<br>
        The Carnegie Mellon University for example has experienced dramatic rise in the percentage of women from 8 (1995) to 42 percent in 1999.<br>
        A major challenge is the lack of self confidence for women. This adds to the tendency of women to perform less well in the beginning, since they often have had less experience with computers at an early age compared to men. Also women often feel less belonging in the study course despite of earning average grades. Hence women need extra encouragement and introductory courses can thwart gender differences.<br>
        Furthermore the incorrect stereotype that computing is anti social and solitary, can be discouraging for women. Counteracting this stereotype, e.g. by inviting industry employees (preferrably women) that report on their daily routine.<br>
        Technology developed by women is vastly different than tech developed by men. "Thus, to ensure that technology is useful for everyone, not just the 49% male population, it is imperative that we have a diverse mixture of people working to design, develop, and implement our computer systems."<br><br>

        <li>Blum, Leonore: <a href="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~lblum/PAPERS/women_in_computer_science.pdf">Women in Computer Science: The Carnegie Mellon Experience</a></li><br>

        *The Computer Science Department at Carnegie Mellon University improved managed to raise the percentage of women entering from 7% to appx. 40 % in 2000. Crucial were findings based on gender studies, support by respected key adminstrators and the commitment of female students and a growing reputation as a place that values and wants women to join.<br>
        Allan Fisher, an Associate Dean, cooperated with Jane Margolis, a social scientist to explore this problem. They conducted hundreds of interviews and found that four crucial problem areas: Experience gap, confidence doubts, curriculum and pedagogy and peer culture. As a result, several initiatives were founded. One of them was a program aimed specifically at teachers that are preparing high school students for a computer science test. It made them more aware of the topic and led to more women taking the test. One crucial effect was that the CMU was generally then considered as a place that valued women.<br>
        The admission office opened up towards qualifications other than programming experience and also it was openly stated that no prior programming experience is necessary. This encouraged women to join.<br>
        As a third result, a supportive community, the "Women @ SCS Advisory Council", was founded. Students from all years were included, who's top priority is Community Building. Their goals were to be fostering a supportive peer environment, communicating the needs of women to administrations, being consultants that provide suggestions and organizing outeach activities to increase the numbers of women.<br>
        The activities of the program:<br>
        - they started a "Little Sister, Big Sister" program that paired students of different classes and organized several dinners and other social events.<br>
        - they advised the faculty on the curriculum, based on the findings, that specifically the first semesters, that are focused on technology, can be discouraging for women. More possibilities to evolve on that and more support in introductory courses are neccessary.<br>
        - they shared their experiences and findings publicly<br>
        - they organized recruitment and outreach events<br>
        The impact was most profound on the women partcipating in the council. Others either were moderately interested or rather denied that there were specific problems for women, inspite of naming the same difficulties (which could be an indicator for insufficiently communicated goals.)<br>
        Far more goals were planned at that time, but the conclusion is a generally valid: "Increasing and "Increasing and maintaining the presence of women in computer science at levels equal to men necessitates taking a hard look at, and changing, business as usual." The resulting changes can be valuable both for men and women.

            3 female scientists from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology opened an AMA (Ask me Anything) thread on reddit and the Internet was pretty Internet about it. Originally the scientists wanted to address issues that affect women in STEM, exchange with others, talk about how they got into the topic. But the most frequent reaction was "Why would you put your gender in the AMA anyways?" which works great as a qed. Because it matters.</li><br>
