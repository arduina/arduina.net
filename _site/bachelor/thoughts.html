	<li>Extra encouragement as a resource</li>
	Almost every expert on this topic named the lack of self esteem as a major and critical issue. At the same time, almost everyone of them insisted on the fact, that women do perform equally well, when given the ressurces they need in order to have the same opportunities. A critical ressource seems to be extra encouragement and invitation. Logically, there must be some impostor thing going on. And as we all know, knowing your faults is the first step towards curing them. Or not-faults, respectively.

	<li>Being too precise when transcribing an Interview</li> 
	One of the interviewed people had concerns about the way I transcribed the interview. For the heck of tracebility I included every "em", "err", grammar mistakes, unfinished sentences and expletives. Actually my supervisore Prof. Dr. Beate Binder even claimed this to be unfair towards the interviewed person because they seem weirdly stupid, when being transcribed exceedingly precise. Beate was also perfectly right when she suggested, that nobody ever makes any use of the "erm"s in a super-authentic interview anyways. Of course, the particularly long breaks and hesitations might be meaningful in an analysis but this can be marked as such. 

	<li>How to conduct a chat interview without making a fool of yourself</li>
	Conducting a chat interview has some great advantages, e.g. not having to transcribe or add time stamps afterwards, can save you about 2 days of work. But from one hour of a chat interview I only yielded half of the content I got from talking to someone for an hour. Also it is important to avoid an asynchronization of question and answers. I agreed with my interview partner that she should end her answers with an (end), so that I knew, I could ask the next question without interrupting her. Otherwise, the notion whether a person has finished or not, is missing. I also missed the opportunity to really "chat" with the person, in a the original meatspace sense. Having a proper exchange is rather difficult, when you are having a Q&A situation in a chat. Every comment from my side was too interruptive. One thing that I liked though, was the possibility to tinker on the next questions and to plan the interview properly while I was chatting. The time she needed for answering could be used for reflecting on the things, that have been said, what information is missing, what questions I still need to ask and so on. This time for reflection is usually missing in a face-to-face-communication, where I mostly feel hurried, especially in a formal interviews. Another plus was the possibility to google a translation for a word I didn't get while I was conducting the interview. <br>
	So here are three recommendations:
	<ul>
		<li>Set a clear time for going online and rather plan for more than the time you expect to need. An hour will yield the results from maximum 30 minutes of talking, which isn't much.</li>
		<li>Schedule the necessary questions beforehand, and add some on a paper while chatting.</li>
		<li>Agree on a code word like (end) in order to know, when the other person has finished an answer.</li>
		<li>Have your opposite prepared for a follow-up, e.g. via Mail, in case you missed out on something.</li>
		<li>Be flexible, you might need to be able to adapt to a crazy GMT when talking to EST.</li>

	</ul>
