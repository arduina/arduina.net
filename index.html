        <p>Hi. My name literally translates to octopus citizen and surprisingly it's not a fake. I was born in Berlin in 1990 and I still live here. I love dogs, tofu and bikes, preferrably in that order.<br>

        Since several years, my work has been driven by the question of how to spread knowledge about technology among a great amount of people that don't have a technical background. I have a genuine interest in how that kind of knowledge can transform and affect practices, cultures and our everyday life. I do believe that a basic knowledge about information technology is fundamental for understanding, valueing and participating in events and politics, that are linked to both, technology and people. 
        I am trying my best with different formats to get this process of knowledge transfer going.
        I tend to talk about this a lot. Sorry. Please get in touch with me, if you want to exchange about these topics.</p>

        <h3>Right now</h3>

        <ul>

            <li>For the next months I will be working on my bachelor thesis and conduct research on factors that affect women's inclination to join or stay away from tech and tech communites. The field has to remain rather broad for right now, but I will go more into detail as soon as I have passed the orientational phase. If you want to talk about this topic, I'd be delighted to do so. Please contact me then.</li><br>

            <li>I am working for the <a href="http://www.okfn.de/">Open Knowledge Foundation</a> in the program <a href="http://www.codefor.de/">Code for Germany</a>, a project aiming at fostering the Open Data movement, building up a community and creating tools for citizens. As a Community Organizer I support a network of approximately 200 volunteer developers, coders, designers and storytellers across 18 cities. They meet on a regular basis to create meaningful civic tech, apps, visualizations and tools with Open Data for their fellow citizens. I work on Code for Germany together with the fabulous project leadand Open Data queen<a href="http://www.juliakloiber.com/">Julia Kloiber</a><br>

            <li>I'm producing a podcast called <a href="http://www.n00bcore.de/">N00bcore</a> in which I meet experts in hacking, technology and network in order to ask them particularly dumb questions. The podcast aims at creating an easy accessible knowledge sharing medium for people, that are interested in technology, but are just as clueless as I used to be not long ago.</li><br>

            <li>I am a student of <a href="http://www.euroethno.hu-berlin.de/">European Ethnology</a> (BA) and I am mainly engaged in research on net cultures, digitalization, knowledge transfer and how we can conduct research in these fields. I am a member of the commission <a href="http://www.goingdigital.de/">Digitalisierung im Alltag.</a></li><br>

            <li>For an annual hacker conference, the <a href="https://events.ccc.de/congress/2014/wiki/Main_Page"></a>Chaos Communication Congress, I organize the Chaos Mentors. The program aims at encouraging people to attend the congress, despite of their inhibitions that might usually keep them from attending. We offer support beforehand and we match the mentees with suitable mentor, according to their interests. On congress, we welcome the mentess, show them around and offer a space for retreat. We want to stress though, that the congress is a great place to be and the communinty is awesome, the need for the Chaos Mentors doesn't stem from the congress itself, but rather it's reputations or assumptions on the hacker community.

        <h3>Not right now</h3>

        <ul>

            <li>In 2014 I was a reporter for the video project "Looking into Black Boxes". Together with Jan Rödger and Dirk Herzog from <a href="http://www.6sept13.de/">6sept13</a>, we discovered algorithms and their role in our everyday life. We visited the places, where software becomes meaningful and we talked to experts. We wanted to inform ourselves and others about a powerful actor and tool of the present. 
            We crowdfunded the project successfully in Spring <A href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0_etg6PMao">(Crowdfunding video on Youtube)</a>. See our first three episodes on our Youtube Channel: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vmMsII8FcN4">Algorithmen, Triage und Mobile Visite</a>. There are English subtitles available. </li><br>

            <li> I started with this whole tech thing in 2012, when I started blogging on <a href="http://fionalerntprogrammieren.wordpress.com/">"Fiona Lernt Programmieren"</a>. Initially, I wanted to simply document what I learnt, but soon relized that people read it mainly to be motivated to learn programming themselves and were also grateful for a learning platform, that is accessible to non-nerds. Since then I consider myself rather as mediating amid cracks and n00bs. 

            <li>I wrote a scientific publication about learning to program as an emancipative practice in the <a href="http://www.panama-verlag.de/programm/update-in-progress/">Berliner Blättern</a></li><br>

            <li>In 2013 I led the media lab at the institute for European Ethnology together with Dr. Sanna Schondelmayr.</li><br>

            <li>I conducted and led a seminar about net cultures at the institute for European Ethnology at the Humboldt University. <a href="http://netzkulturen.net">Netzkulturen</a></li> <br>

            <li>I wrote an article for Zeit Online about the Augmented Reality Game "Ingress": <a href="http://www.zeit.de/digital/internet/2013-10/ingress-augmented-reality/komplettansicht">Die Humboldt Uni gehört jetzt mir!</a>.</li><br>

            <li>From May to October 2011 I was employed by the German government to work as a social media consultant for MDB Christian Ströbele <a href="http://twitter.com/mdb_stroebele">Hans-Christian Ströbele (MdB)</a></li></br>

            <li>From 2009 to 2012 I worked as a freelance photo journalist and documentary and portrait photographer. I was founder and part of the team at <a href="http://www.echtfotografie.de">echtfotografie</a></li><br>

            <li>In 2009 I was an intern as a web editor for the german NGO <a href="http://attac.de"></a>attac in Frankfurt.</li><br>

        <h3>Geht immer</h3>
        
        <ul>
            <li>I play the violin in a band. To be honest, we are a 30-people orchestra in colorful clothes, that play exclusively songs about the sun and the summer. On children's instruments. I shit you not, we are the <a href="http://www.ompberlin.de/">Orchestre Miniature in the Park</a>.</li><br>

            <li>I take photos of my life without me, check them out <a href="http://fotografiona.tumblr.com">here.</a></li><br>

            <li>I stole this lean, minimalistic design from the <a href="http://motherfuckingwebsite.com">Motherfucking Website</a>.</li>
