<p><b>Speaking about Women in Tech</b></p>

<p><br />
</p>

<p>At the Chaos Communication Camp in August 2015 I spoke about challenges for women in tech and how we as key figures in tech can resolve these issues to make our community landscape more diverse. I decided to write down the talk's content and offer another medium besides the recording and also for providing more resources in the footnotes.</p>

<p>I was very happy to get the chance to bring this issue up, which I think is not a given. Especially recently it seems as if the entire discussion about gender and technology has been heated up and determined by conflict, accusation and confrontation. I personally believe that collaboration and explanation are key if we really want to change something.</p>

<p>Hence I'll happily share the insights I gathered over the past years, being active in the field of Digital Literacy and the research I conducted to complement my experiences. </p>

<p>I'll first give a short insight into the gender disparity in tech, after that I'll provide an overview, or rather selection, of the most frequently mentioned challenges for women in tech. I'll then suggest some solutions that we as a tech community can apply to yield change. At the end I'll also give a shot at why we should care at all. I understand that not everybody considers this as an urgent matter, but I'll offer some explanation and some arguments why I think everybody should care.</p>

<p><i>Disclaimer: I am well aware that I am talking in binaries here. As in every feminist endeavor I have the unit problem – in order to talk about women in tech I have to talk about women. I want to state clearly, that there are many people of different genders that do not fit into my descriptions. But for the sake of tackling an existing problem, I will talk about women and hence generalize a lot. I kindly ask you pardon this. I also neglect a lot of other underrepresented groups, but I personally strongly believe, that increased gender diversity and hence changing circumstances will also </i> </p>

<p><b>No women in tech?</b></p>

<p>For my research, I have been roaming through numerous articles and statistics that depict the huge gender disparity in tech jobs and education. The percentage of women who study Computer Science in Germany was at 14% in 2013,<a name="sdfootnote1anc" href="#sdfootnote1sym"><sup>1</sup></a> though the number is on the rise. The number of women who work in related fields lingers around 14 to16%.<a name="sdfootnote2anc" href="#sdfootnote2sym"><sup>2</sup></a> But instead of boring you with statistics and numbers, I'd rather acknowledge that everyone of you is very well informed about the disparity. We all know this fairly well from conferences, hacker spaces, open source development and from our development team. Fewer women in tech is something we are really used to and hardly notice. But why are there so few women in tech? </p>

<p>People that are into Computer History are probably already well informed about the fact, that this hasn't always been the case. In the early 20<sup>th</sup> Century, a computer was a person fulfilling the task of...well – computing. This person used to be a woman usually, later the computer operators were often women as well. From the very beginning of computer history, there were numerous prominent examples of female computer scientists that were responsible for major breakthroughs in computing (see this elaborate list of important female computer scientists).<a name="sdfootnote3anc" href="#sdfootnote3sym"><sup>3</sup></a></p>

<p>So when and why did this change? There are numerous reasons and of the most compelling comes from the US American podcast „Planet Money“. In the US, the number of women getting into computer science started to dwindle dramatically in the middle of the 80ies. This correlates with a very particular mile stone in the history of the computer: The rise of the home computer.</p>

<p>That decade, computers became a product that families and households could afford and they were almost entirely marketed to boys. Consequently, boys were far more likely to have a computer in their bedroom, being exposed to technology for a far longer time than girls were, when they entered school. This development was fueling the actual advantage of boys in computing and the creation of a stereotype:</p>

<p><i>This idea that computers are for boys became a narrative. It became the story we told ourselves about the computing revolution. It helped define who geeks were, and it created techie culture.</i></p>

<p>In the end both the head start of boys in school and the establishment of a stereotype led to a development that continues up until today. The disappearance of women in computer science certainly had manifold reasons, but the strong reification of a stereotype with ads and movies certainly plays a vital and international role. </p>

<p>However, this can be considered a new perspective: The lack of women in computing is a development and process with a history. This is about their disappearance, not about any naturally given disadvantage. With the beginning of the 90ies, numerous longterm studies and research turned up. In the following, I will elaborate on some of the most frequently mentioned challenges for women in tech. </p>

<p><br />
</p>

<p><b>Why are there no women in tech?</b></p>


<p>One of the most helpful resources for this was the report written by Ellen Spertus in 1991: „Why Are There So Few Female Computer Scientists?" I strongly recommend this report to anyone, who is interested in the topic but hasn't been exposed to feminist literature for a decade. Ellen Spertus who is now a professor of computer science has been asking herself this question since she was a kid and decided to search for answers when she was an under graduate – the result can be read in this report, where she offers very basic and accessible explanations that were elaborated in the ensuing two decades by a growing academic research body. </p>

<p><b>Stereotypes</b></p>

<p>One of the challenges that women are facing is strongly linked to the above mentioned rise of the personal computer: Stereotypes.</p>

<p>Stereotypes aren't necessarily something bad by default. Actually, they are incredibly helpful. They are part of our mental capability to process all the millions of impressions we get at any given moment by categorizing, grouping and clustering what we see. <br />
But in order to understand why there is such a huge fuss about stereotypes, it is important to consider stereotype as a mental concept that never comes alone, there are always attributions linked to them. These attributions and the lines we draw among different stereotypes and people are determined by our social and cultural background, so they are always constructed. What some people in Germany consider a „Südländer“ is most likely not a valid or helpful category for people in Greece or Turkey. But in Germany, this category makes sense to some people and they also attribute certain traits to this group, that tend to be negative. </p>

<p>Stereotypes are not only assisting us in categorizing our environment, they are also very powerful when it comes to the connotations. We do not necessarily attribute traits only, we also expect these traits that are culturally attached, to be true. You might have heard of the term „self-fulfilling prophecy“. What sounds somewhat esoteric is actually a phenomenon called „stereotype threat“ that has been explored by numerous studies from social psychology. One of the most impressive examples stems from an experiment that was conducted in 1999 at Harvard.<a name="sdfootnote4anc" href="#sdfootnote4sym"><sup>4</sup></a> Prof. Dr. Margaret Shih depicted in her report „Stereotype Susceptibility: Identity Salience and Shifts in Quantative Performance“ how the simple act of naming their gender or race prior to a math test could affect the performance of asian-american women. Those who only mentioned their gender performed below the expected average, those who only mentioned their immigrant background performed above the average. The simple activation of stereotypes that are relevant to performance can actually determine the outcome. </p>

<p>This in incredibly important for understanding how stereotypes about women and nerds are not always reflecting but shaping reality. And what is often omitted in the public discussion: There are strong stereotypes about women, like women being bad at everything linked to technology, but there also strong stereotypes about the „Nerd himself“. Being a rather socially awkward male person loitering and tinkering in the cellars of parents and institutes, shying away from daylight. While this might be true for some hackers and programmers, this is by far not common and I assume that a lot of programmers and hackers do not identify with this image either.</p>

<p>When our stereotypes restrict other people's possibilities, they are called prejudices. When people live up to the expectations that come along with a stereotype, we call this stereotype threat.</p>

<p>So if a man with a migration background is living in a context where people like him are expected to be less intelligent and criminal, he is not very likely to experience equal chances in this country.</p>

<p>Similarly, if a girl is exposed to the idea and stereotype of girls being bad at math and is never being encouraged, chances are good that she won't be great at math. Or at least, it takes more effort and lucky circumstances for her to pursue a math career. </p>

<p><br />
</p>

<p><b>Confidence</b></p>


<p>In my research for which I interviewed different initiatives,<a name="sdfootnote5anc" href="#sdfootnote5sym"><sup>5</sup></a> the lack of self confidence among women was repeatedly mentioned as one of the core problems.<a name="sdfootnote6anc" href="#sdfootnote6sym"><sup>6</sup></a> This lack of self-confidence is fueled by stereotypes and their effects and fosters the persistence of stereotypes in return. In Jane Margolis long-term research about students at Carnegie Mellon University she discovered large differences in the self-evaluation of female and male students.<a name="sdfootnote7anc" href="#sdfootnote7sym"><sup>7</sup></a> In Laura E. Hirshfields report „She won't make me feel dumb“ the development and stabilization of a wrong and negative self-assessment of women from early days in elementary school to obstacles in academic career steps.</p>

<p><br />
</p>

<p>Even from my own relatively short time as a person that is repeatedly positioned at the intersection of women and tech, talking to women, teaching stuff to women and girls, I have identified this as a major obstacle for women. Their concerns of not being good enough or fear of not living up to the necessary skill set for studying computer science, visiting a tech conference or even confronting a community when they want to ask something they don't know<a name="sdfootnote8anc" href="#sdfootnote8sym"><sup>8</sup></a> are hindering them from actually getting into tech and improving their skills.</p>

<p><br />
</p>

<p>This is not only true for tech, most women generally tend to judge their abilities below their actual capabilities. Tech, though, offers very strong stereotypes that foster this misconception. </p>

<p>Lastly, I assume that this is hardly news for anyone, most of us, especially those that are based in contexts and communities where women are rare, are well aware that women often lack the self confidence we would consider appropriate. And often women themselves are aware of this as a personal problem, something that is often coined as impostor (hough I am personally critical towards trending diagnoses.)</p>

<p><br />
</p>

<p><br />
</p>

<p><b>Structural Issues </b> </p>

<p><br />
</p>

<p>It always feels a little awkward to use the term „structural“, but in the absence of a better term, I'll use it for conditions that are already deeply embedded in the structure of our society and an effect of the factors mentioned earlier. </p>

<p><br />
</p>

<p>One of these structural preconditions is the lack of computers in girls' bedrooms, which has been briefly described before. With the lack of a exposure to technology, girls are already disadvantaged in school, at the first encounter with computers in class. This leads to less and less girls that are inclined to take further computer classes and the first dropout of girls is created. </p>

<p>Later, consequently, less women chose computer science as a study course, but even if they do, there are more <b>leaks in the pipeline.</b> Women are often more inclined to change their residence in favor of their male partners. And women can become pregnant, which is still a huge obstacle career wise and often appears in times, when critical career options are in reach. Hence, again, women drop out on the way to the top management and professor positions. </p>

<p><br />
</p>

<p>Additionally this is linked to <b>resources</b> if women are responsible of the so called care work, less and less time is available for tinkering on programming languages and technology. </p>

<p><br />
</p>

<p><br />
</p>

<p>Strongly linked to stereotypes is the <b>lack of positive role models</b>. Female speakers and prominent figures in tech and tech communities are still seldom, though the number is visibly increasing. But it's not only the sparkling hacker super stars, it's also the everyday coworker, developer, engineer that is far too often displayed as male, while in reality, there are plenty of female examples. The more positive role models there are, the more obvious and accessible a career in stem and interest in computers can be to girls and women.</p>

<p><br />
</p>

<p><br />
</p>

<p><br />
</p>

<p><b>Hacks</b></p>

<p><br />
</p>

<p>Having pondered on the manifold problems, issues and challenges, let's move on to the solutions. I have tied together what I consider the most effective changes that almost everyone and every community can work on and that are tackling the particular challenges I have mentioned above. The solutions I am suggesting are gathered from years of being embedded in the field of digital literacy, from the chaos mentors, that I co-organized (a project aimed at inviting and onboarding new people to a tech conference) and a research I conducted over the past 6 months, for which I examined different initiatives and their strategies. </p>

<p><br />
</p>

<p><br />
</p>

<ol> <li><p><b>Be explicit and inviting</b></p>

</li>
</ol><p><br />
</p>

<p>This might seem way too easy, but its effective and yet still new to a lot of people I talked to: If you are open to women and welcoming women or other underrepresented groups at your event, your community, your company or study course: Say it. State this clearly on the landing page of your website. Women need extra encouragement, so invite them and offer them a slight sensation of being welcomed. This can also be a powerful message to all other attendees and eventually even improve the overall attitude towards women. These kinds of changes need to be exemplified by respected and prominent people. </p>

<p><br />
</p>

<ol start="2"> <li><p>Give room to positive role models</p>

</li>
</ol><p><br />
</p>

<p>There is a lack of positive female role models in tech, but this shouldn't be reduced to the lack of women in tech. People who are involved in computer science or hacker spaces know, that there are plenty of cool women, who just usually aren't in the spot light. Sometimes the necessary room for them needs to be created, by explicitly inviting them to talk about their hacks or to be more visible. Also, when speakers for tech conferences are invited, it makes sense give it another thought, whether there might be a female person just as qualified as the male speaker, you instantly thought of. </p>
