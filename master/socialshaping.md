Introductory Essay


Technological Determinism as a Theory of Society: 
- Technology matters
- When we adopt a technology, there's opting for far more, economically, politically, culturally - asking for this more is difficult but important


Technological Determinism as a Theory of Technology: 
- Technology is not independent from Society, it can be shaped, not only be adapted to 
- resonates with Beck's account of reflexive modernization


Does Science shape Technology?
- The notion that Technology is just applied science, is wrong in several aspects
- scientific work draws from a wider range of society (it's not only science discovering)
- Technologists USE science (do not only apply it)
- technology and science have not always been connected
- technology has contributed to science just as much

The technological shaping of Technology
- goes against the notion of the genius sole inventor
- inventions are according to Ogburn and Thomas inevitable, they occur independently from each other
- they are results of the modification of existing technologies 
- it's a process of collective learning wiht anonymous contributors
- new technology emerges from eisting technology 
- technological paradigm/system:
	- 1. an exemplar (theoreme, technology, etc.) becomes the exemplar for future work 
	- 2. an entire constallation of beliefsm values and techniques that are shared by members of a given community 
- the paradigm is not projecting a trajectory, but it's a resource that can be used differently
- it's not a natural trajectory, but affected by social factors


The economic Shaping of Technology
- Notion of a general goal 
- technological decision are also economic decisiones
- explaining technological change by sseeind technology not outside of society
- neoclassical approach: Assumption that firms will choose the technique of production that most profitable - has been subject ot criticism since companies cannot know which technology is going to be profitable


Economic Shaoing is Social Shaping
- alternative views consider more sociological explanations
- costs and profits matter enourmlously, but they aren't given facts, but uncertain 
- economic calculation however is particular to forms of society, e.g. soviet or american model to yield profits and prices
- economic calculation reamins a mechanism of social shaping and a cost is not isolated
- cost of labour is an important issue in technical change, and labor reflects deep-seated social assumptions, e.g. in gendered technological change


Technology and the State
- social relations affect technological change through shaping the market framework
- but this is only one of many social institutions
- states are important drivers of techology, most importantly by sponsoring military technology, that overcomes formerly insuperable economic barriers


Case Studies of the Shaping of Technology 
- Shaping should not be understood as always being direct and conscious as the simple imprinting of human will
- technology is by no means what an actor had intended
- it's often a mixture of backgrounds, cultures and actors, e.g. in the case of hypertext 
- it is the result of way of thinking but also the very materiality of machines 
- social shaping:
	- shaping, because things are not constructed out of nothing, but something existent is being worked on
	- it's not a reference to wider "external" societal relations like classe or gender, but more immediately relevant are local considerations, such as engineers memberships or reward structures in communities


The Path-Dependence of Technical Change 

deep-seated determinist assumptions might see an indication in these case studies, that the best technology will eventually succeed. There are two answers:
- the definition of a best technology may vary strongly depending on the viewpoint, of a worker, of a woman, etc. 
- a technology has a path-dependent history, where past events continue to exercise influence
- a technology's triumph does not necessarily mean it's the best technology, it can also be linked to early adoption and hence entailing success
- e.g. the QWERTY keyboard, which is kind of a lock-in in an inferior technique
- though this has to be considered with care, there are ways to overcome a lock-in

Theorizing the Technology-Society Relationship

Two theoretical approaches:

1. The social construction of technology (trevor Pinch & Wiebe Bijker)
Focus on the interpretative flexibility of technology - whether a technology work, what it's character is, etc. differs among relevant social groups. Relies on previous works that stated, that the notion of of true scientific knowledge wasn't the result of unaided human rationality.
According to Pinch & Biijker, machines work because they have been accepted by relevant social groups and the fact that  a machine works should rather be explained than taken for granted. 

Shortcomings: Structural exclusion is not acknowledged. Relevant social groups may be pre filtered, not taking underrepresented groups into account. Furthermore is doesn't take the reciprocal relationship between artifacts and social groups into account, as the following does:


2. Actor-Network-Theory (Latour et. al.)

Previous theories often neglected the influence of technology upon social relations. 
- Technology and Society are mututally constitutive. 
- The human use of material resources and symbold enables large-scale-societies. 
- Explanations of our society would alway recur to technology, which differntiates us from Baboons. 
- Society and technology are made of the same stuff: Networks linking human beings and non-human entities (actants)


Constructing Gender; Constructing Color 

- Cynthia Cockburn: has explored the mutual constitution between society and technology
- also asks: Is technology shaped by gender and is gender shaped by technology
- military, industrial technologies are masculine in a very historical and material sense 
- Ruth Cowan notes that artifacts and knowledge associated with women is often not seen as technical, like the baby bottle
- gendering of technologies: Appropriation of technology by men, the exclusion of women leaves marks in the design of tasks and machines
- they are also part of the shaping of gender by creating different role models, domestic responsibilities, schooling... this contributes to the construction of men as strong, and women as physically and technically incompetent 


The same applies to ethnicity and technology but this hasn't been explored as much, it did shape the way photography and film technology developed.

Langdon Winner: Do artifacts have politics? 

Low bridges in New York embody systematic social inequality, that became part of the lanscape, not letting black and lower income people travel to recreational spaces in public transport. Similar to big plazas and streets, preventing fighting or demonstrations. Certain newly introduced machines weren't more cost-effective, but had the ability to alter or destroy workers' unions. 
While it does make sense to move away from a technicaldeterminist way that covers up the actors and underlying interests, Langdon calls for a focus back on the things themselves, for they entail sets of consequences prior to any professed use. 

Langdon offers a general conclusion: The things we call technologies are ways of building order in our world. Many devices and systems contain possibilities for ordering human activities, like communication, travel, consuming... the number of possible choices is greater in the beginning, but then becomes fixed in material, habit, investments. Technological innovations are similar to legislative acts or political foundings, that establish a framework. The issues that divide or unite people in society are settled in the institutions and practices of policits and in tangible arrangements. 


Inherently political technologies: 

The belief that technologies are political entails the view that the adoption of a technical system brings with it conditions for human relationships that have a political cast, like decentralization. Most technologies are relatively flexible in their design, arrangement and effects. Certain kinds aren't and chosing them means chosing a particular form of political life. [contrary to legislative technology that has a cast, some technologies will have an apriori set of consequences that requires and forms society]

Two ways how technologies are inherently political: 
1. The adoption of a technical system requires the creation and maintenacne of social conditions as operating environment 
2. A technology doesn't require but it's strongly compatible with social and political relationships, like solar energy as a distributed system is more compatible with a democratic egalitarian society (though it doesn't require democracy)

So the resulting question is: Are the social conditions predicted required or compatible with a technical system? Are these conditions internal or external? Discussions about this enter into an important sphere of analysis: The arguments stand apart from more common quantifiable claims about economic costs and benefist. The issue raised is about the ways in which choices about technology have consequences on human associations. 

When devices are linked to specific ways of organizing power and authority - does this derive from a social repsonse to the things' properties or is it a pattern imposed by a governing body to further it's purposes? E.g. the social system of an atom bomb must be authoritarian, the construction of the American railway required an administrative organization at last, with managers and levels, compared to traditional family sized businesses. 

If these systems are to work effectively and efficiently, quickly and safely, certain requirements of internal social organization have to be fulfilled.
Evidence seems to show, that large technical systems are highly compatible with centralized hierarchical managerial control. But is it right to say that these systems require this control?

To answer this questions, one has to examine how moral claims of practical neccessity are played out against moral claims of other sorts. In societies, based on large technological systems, it is common that moral claims other than of practical necessity are being seen as obsolete and idealistic and are eclipsed by the technical imperative. 

Politics of the entire community cannot be easily separted from politics of technology. The operational requirements of the usage of plutonium raises the prospect that extraordinary measures would be necessary to prevent it from theft, e.g. high security checks. 

-> Once a course of action is underway, reasonings to justify the adaption of social life pop up as spontaeously as flowers in the spring. And those that cannot accept the hard requirements are dismissed as dreamers and fools. 


Summary: 

1. devices and systems can provide a convenient means of establishing patterns of power and authority in a given setting - these technologies have a range of flexibility in their material form. For this flexibility it is important to understand their consequences, in order to direct them. 

2. other devices and systems are strongly, perhaps unavoidably linked to patterns of power and authority. The decision is whether or not to adopt, since there are no alternative physical deisng or arrangements, and no possibilites for creative internvention by social systems - the consequences are inherent. 

These two understanding can intersect and overlap. 


--> In our times people are often willing to make drastic changes in the way the live to accord with technological innovation at the same time they would resist similar kinds of changes justified on political grounds. For that reasons it is important to achieve a clearer view of these matters.

Donna J. Haraway: Modest Witness @ Second Millennium 

Haraway wants to make explicit the "tropic quality" of all material-semiotic processes, especially in technoscience. Small objects like chips or genes are simultaneously literal and figurative, the map universes of knowledge, pracitce and power. Technoscience is the globalization of this. 
Hypercapitalist markets, biosphere programs, entertainment events produce cyborgs. Cyborgs are cybernetic organisms, a fusion of the organic and the technical forged in particular historical cultural practices. They are not about human and machine, (if these terms ever existed as such) but about specific "historical machines" and poeple in interaction This is often counterintuitive for analysts, since the term cyborg originally was coined to describe an enhanced man. 

Haraway adopts the view of rodents, tools and research material, to look back at her "fellow mammals"

The distinction between nature and culture is sacred in western traditions. The human place in nature seems to be at stake now. But it's - according to haraway - a mistake to forget, that anxiety about lineages is at the origin of racist and sexist discourse in Europe. The limits between divine creation and human engineering made way for molecular genetics and biotechnology. Couplings across taxonomies are happening daily in genetic laboratories. 

On the one hand biotechnology is oppsed by those, who fear commercialization and expropritation of animal or plant genetics. But this collapsing of genetics, profit and exploitation is just as much a mistake as the right reduction of biological complexitiy. 

[What follows is an analogy of stem cells as universal and potentially everything and certain technoscientific achievements, but I'm lost here, as always and I cannot be bothered to follow Haraway]

Eda Kranakis: Constructing a Bridge 

This article describes how two architects applied different strategies to successfully innovate suspension bridges.

James Finley, an american inventor of the 18th century, had economic considerations in mind when developing a suspension bridge. His concept involved a patent and mass compatibility. His design was supposed to uncomplicated to build, didn't need highly skilled workers, no excess materials and a step by step guide for the craftsmen. Finley used an inductive reasoning approach and emphazised the use of experimentation and observation. 

Claus-Louis-Marie-Henri Navier's approach was fundamentally different (about 30 years later). He was a salaried employee in the Corps des Ponts et Chausées, and he had dual ties to the engineering and mathematical communities. Navier didn't attempt to patent a design or conduct experiments, he created mathematical descriptions of the curves and movements of supsension bridges. 

Navier's design was socially shaped in the sense that he ecployed a set of mathematical tools and techniques which were taugt and developed at his own institutional environment. 

-> People most readliy use the tools that are available and accepted and relevant in their own environment.

What Navier's theory ignored and what it analyzed reflected goals and priorities stemming from or rooting in his environment. It wasn't only dictated by the technology but it was also a question of who he wanted to impress [or had to?] and what mathematical issues were currently of concern in the scientific community. 

Navier's bridge was intended to serve as a monument, in accordance to the buildings in the vicinity, contrary to Finley's approach. 

-> The technical features of the designs embodied their knowlege, their goals and their ideas about how the structures would be built. 
-> The environments shaped the strategies of the two individuals - the environments aren't all-knowable or one-dimensional, and there is a host of factors, but they do limit the range of strategies that can be chosen to succeed

Three dimensions:

intellectual dimension: Finley adopted an empirico-inductive research methodology and helped to ensure that his findings would be understood. Navier followed a theoretico-deductive methodology that was respected amid his community, ensuring that his research would be considered valuable. 

economic dimension: Finley had to sell many bridges to earn a reasonable profit through royalites. Navier was salaried and didn't have to compete on the market at all, he was striking chords by presenting his bridge as a sophisticated application of theory. 

Organizational dimension: They were built within different organizational structures and networks. 
Finley made use of the patent system. Navier was employed by the Corps des Ponts et Chausées. Finley adapted his design to this organizational context by creating a generic design and a guide. He maximized ease of contruction and minimized the need for technical expertise. 
Navier had to accept design changes by his superiors, but he had strict technical control over the building process. He adapted his design by presupposing highly skilled labor and the ability of control. 

-> Both Navier and Finley innovated, but their innovative work wasn't a transcendent quest for novelty, it was fundamentally structured by their respective environments.

 W. Brian Arthur: Competing technologies and economic prediction 

End of the 19th century, there were three way to power automobiles: Steam, eletricity and gasoline, while gasoline was the inferior technology. Arthur explains this with a theory of increasing return to adoption. The more a technology is adopted, the more it is improved and the more attractive it becomes, eventually having all groups of customers switching to and chosing this technology. 


Four key features:

1. The technology that "wins" a market does not necessarily have to be the best or most efficient
2. An industry can get locked in to a technologcal path, and it's difficult to get away from, the other technologies get frozen our and often disappear
3. Even with hindsight, reasons for an adoption are difficult to pinpoint 
4. Even if we know all the preferences of the market, the outcome is almost impossible to foresee which technology will dominate 


Implications:

If this mechanism is valid, history would have a fossil record of technologies that could have been as good or might have been better. Today, we would see technologies we are stuck with, like FORTRAN or the QWERTY keyboard (another standard couldn't be found in 1904 because typing teachers opposed change).
The fittest technology may not survive, hence the government may need to step in and encourage and protect infant technologies. But this is hard, as there is an obvious cost to exploring large numbers of unknown technological paths. 


-> We should be careful in interpreting economic history, we usually look for reasons why a predominant technology is superior, and how this led to adoption. 
-> Superiority becomes a function of adoption or use

Ronald Kline and Trevor Pinch: The social construction of technology 

SCOT - developed by Trevor Pinch and Wiebe Bijker, has several advantages in analyzing users as agents of technological change. 

In the approach, relevant social groups are groups who share a meaning og the artifact. This particular meaning can be used to explain developmental paths. These groups might include engineers, consumers and so on, and they aren't static. Besides a shared meaning of an artifact, they may also share other traits, like women sharing their role on the family. 

SCOT emphasized the interpretative flexibility of an artifact. Women saw bikes as dangerous, and rather a mean of transportation, men saw a bike as a sports tool, which could be embedded in the further developmental paths, making a bike even faster. Interpretative flexibility is ot indefinit, closure and stablozation occur, but rival technologies can exist side by side. This closure can also be dissolved by new problems emerging. 

SCOT emphasizes artifacts as subject to different intepretations along social groups. 

Weaknesses: 
- SCOT deals mainly with the design stage
- the notion of closure was too rigid, what's missing is a sensose of how and in what circumstances the black box can be reopened by different social groups  
-it says little about social structure and power relations within which development takes place
- neglect of the reciprocal relationship between artifacts and social groups, not only the technology is shaped, the identities of social gorups are reconstituted in the process as well

Shirley Strum and Bruno Latour: Redefining the social link: From baboons to humans 

[Not really relevant for my studies, but it opens up interesting dichotomies between complexity and complication in social structures. Society and it's rules, orders, hierarchies etc. are seen as performative, being performed by actions. Otherwise it wouldn't have to be renegotiated constantly. Modern industrial societies have stable complicated strutures, that are organized and mobilizes on a grand scale, with the help of artifacts and symbols.]

Cynthia Cockburn: Caught in the Wheels: The high cost of being a femlae cog in the male machinery of engineering 

Why do women chose not to become technicians and engineers? Do they even chose or are they pushed and what choice exactly are they offered?


Equal Chances? 

"Initiatives to date have been based on the philosophy that women must be given 'more confidence' [...] I would suggest that women know very well both where we are unwelcome and what we are rejecting. We are not failing. We are on strike" p. 127



Technology: Neither neuter nor neutral

The prevailing belief is that technology is neutral and equally available and relevant to us all. Women just have to reach out and grasp ist. But technology is far from neutral, it bears the marks and serves the purposes of the class that owns it. "Industrial, commercial, military technologies are masculine in a very historical and material sense. They cannot readily be used in a feminine, nor even a sexless, mode. Women are not merely failing to enter technology.  On the one hand we are being repelled, and on the other we are refusing." p. 127

To this relates the male appropariation of work - model for the employer is a man, by men's design. Women's physiology is seen as defective, not as a norm. 



All the Manly Virtues 

The norm for the industrial woker in general is male, engineereing represents everything that is defined as manly: controlling nature, muscle, machine, dirt, grease, swarf... while any other kind of dirt is seen to be more bearable for women, lile blood or vomit. Technical work involves physical risk, masculine patterns of relationshsops, camaraderie and slander concerning women. Additionally it is embedded in a capitalis business world, it's competitive and about performance. 

-> These values have "developed out of patriarchy, and on the other have developed to make patriarchy what it is in modern society. The relations surrounding technology continually renew and extend male hegemony over the rest of us. The growth of industrial technology has to be seen as part and parcel of the historical development of gender difference. It has been formative in thr growth of class relations. But is has also been part of what has made males into 'men' and females into 'girls'." p. 129


Women's Values

In women's work domain it seems as if the social purpose of work is more important, like nursing, teaching and social work. This difference is not immutable, it is the results of hundreds of years, society has constructed gender difference and continues to confrm and elaborate it every day. And much about the feminine gender is good - Cockburn opts for keeping up this concern for feelings and people, and not trading off in order to take on technology: "We don#t want to exchange the society of women for the society of men, to become a kind of de-sexed satellite of a male world" 


Moving Forward

Moving forward into the industrial field comes at a great individual cost and cost to the movement by a drain of strong women. And yet, power lies in the economic ownership of the technical forces of production - "we cannot continue to be the passive objects of some technologies (at the receiving end of medical and military technologies, for instance [...] we have to learn technical skills. if we are to learn, we have to get in there. It cannot be done at a distance."

Cockburn relates the barriers between women and tech to other physical taboos, like getting dirty, spreading legs, exerting muscular force."


On our Terms

Women shouldn't deny their social values and turn to industrial sectors that seem to be more humanly useful and malleable.
Self-organized collectives of women are already separating out the already difficult relations of technology from those of capitalist employment 


organising Independece

Cockburn asks for woman-only organisations and demands massive increase in resources by the state for women-run initiatives. To counter the ongoing marginalization (despite mutilation), we need to form women's groups to help each other. 


Women-Led, can it work? 

More revolutionary than autonomy itself is a situation with women in leadership and majority. Men's reluctance to participate on such terms would expose the orginal separatists. Such a strategy is impossible until more women participate and are trained and willing to enter these situations.

Richard Dyer: Making 'white' people white 

Article on the development of film camera and photography technology, which always favored lighter skin. This is because they were made that way, not because they coudn't be different. Innovation in photographic media has generally taken a white face as the norm.
