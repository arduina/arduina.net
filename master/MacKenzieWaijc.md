Introductory Essay


Technological Determinism as a Theory of Society: 
- Technology matters
- When we adopt a technology, there's opting for far more, economically, politically, culturally - asking for this more is difficult but important


Technological Determinism as a Theory of Technology: 
- Technology is not independent from Society, it can be shaped, not only be adapted to 
- resonates with Beck's account of reflexive modernization


Does Science shape Technology?
- The notion that Technology is just applied science, is wrong in several aspects
- scientific work draws from a wider range of society (it's not only science discovering)
- Technologists USE science (do not only apply it)
- technology and science have not always been connected
- technology has contributed to science just as much

The technological shaping of Technology
- goes against the notion of the genius sole inventor
- inventions are according to Ogburn and Thomas inevitable, they occur independently from each other
- they are results of the modification of existing technologies 
- it's a process of collective learning wiht anonymous contributors
- new technology emerges from eisting technology 
- technological paradigm/system:
	- 1. an exemplar (theoreme, technology, etc.) becomes the exemplar for future work 
	- 2. an entire constallation of beliefsm values and techniques that are shared by members of a given community 
- the paradigm is not projecting a trajectory, but it's a resource that can be used differently
- it's not a natural trajectory, but affected by social factors


The economic Shaping of Technology
- Notion of a general goal 
- technological decision are also economic decisiones
- explaining technological change by sseeind technology not outside of society
- neoclassical approach: Assumption that firms will choose the technique of production that most profitable - has been subject ot criticism since companies cannot know which technology is going to be profitable


Economic Shaoing is Social Shaping
- alternative views consider more sociological explanations
- costs and profits matter enourmlously, but they aren't given facts, but uncertain 
- economic calculation however is particular to forms of society, e.g. soviet or american model to yield profits and prices
- economic calculation reamins a mechanism of social shaping and a cost is not isolated
- cost of labour is an important issue in technical change, and labor reflects deep-seated social assumptions, e.g. in gendered technological change


Technology and the State
- social relations affect technological change through shaping the market framework
- but this is only one of many social institutions
- states are important drivers of techology, most importantly by sponsoring military technology, that overcomes formerly insuperable economic barriers


Case Studies of the Shaping of Technology 
- Shaping should not be understood as always being direct and conscious as the simple imprinting of human will
- technology is by no means what an actor had intended
- it's often a mixture of backgrounds, cultures and actors, e.g. in the case of hypertext 
- it is the result of way of thinking but also the very materiality of machines 
- social shaping:
	- shaping, because things are not constructed out of nothing, but something existent is being worked on
	- it's not a reference to wider "external" societal relations like classe or gender, but more immediately relevant are local considerations, such as engineers memberships or reward structures in communities


The Path-Dependence of Technical Change 

deep-seated determinist assumptions might see an indication in these case studies, that the best technology will eventually succeed. There are two answers:
- the definition of a best technology may vary strongly depending on the viewpoint, of a worker, of a woman, etc. 
- a technology has a path-dependent history, where past events continue to exercise influence
- a technology's triumph does not necessarily mean it's the best technology, it can also be linked to early adoption and hence entailing success
- e.g. the QWERTY keyboard, which is kind of a lock-in in an inferior technique
- though this has to be considered with care, there are ways to overcome a lock-in

Theorizing the Technology-Society Relationship

Two theoretical approaches:

1. The social construction of technology (trevor Pinch & Wiebe Bijker)
Focus on the interpretative flexibility of technology - whether a technology work, what it's character is, etc. differs among relevant social groups. Relies on previous works that stated, that the notion of of true scientific knowledge wasn't the result of unaided human rationality.
According to Pinch & Biijker, machines work because they have been accepted by relevant social groups and the fact that  a machine works should rather be explained than taken for granted. 

Shortcomings: Structural exclusion is not acknowledged. Relevant social groups may be pre filtered, not taking underrepresented groups into account. Furthermore is doesn't take the reciprocal relationship between artifacts and social groups into account, as the following does:


2. Actor-Network-Theory (Latour et. al.)

Previous theories often neglected the influence of technology upon social relations. 
- Technology and Society are mututally constitutive. 
- The human use of material resources and symbold enables large-scale-societies. 
- Explanations of our society would alway recur to technology, which differntiates us from Baboons. 
- Society and technology are made of the same stuff: Networks linking human beings and non-human entities (actants)


Constructing Gender; Constructing Color 

- Cynthia Cockburn: has explored the mutual constitution between society and technology
- also asks: Is technology shaped by gender and is gender shaped by technology
- military, industrial technologies are masculine in a very historical and material sense 
- Ruth Cowan notes that artifacts and knowledge associated with women is often not seen as technical, like the baby bottle
- gendering of technologies: Appropriation of technology by men, the exclusion of women leaves marks in the design of tasks and machines
- they are also part of the shaping of gender by creating different role models, domestic responsibilities, schooling... this contributes to the construction of men as strong, and women as physically and technically incompetent 


The same applies to ethnicity and technology but this hasn't been explored as much, it did shape the way photography and film technology developed. 



Langdon Winner: Do artifacts have politics? 

Low bridges in New York embody systematic social inequality, that became part of the lanscape, not letting black and lower income people travel to recreational spaces in public transport. Similar to big plazas and streets, preventing fighting or demonstrations. Certain newly introduced machines weren't more cost-effective, but had the ability to alter or destroy workers' unions. 
While it does make sense to move away from a technicaldeterminist way that covers up the actors and underlying interests, Langdon calls for a focus back on the things themselves, for they entail sets of consequences prior to any professed use. 

Langdon offers a general conclusion: The things we call technologies are ways of building order in our world. Many devices and systems contain possibilities for ordering human activities, like communication, travel, consuming... the number of possible choices is greater in the beginning, but then becomes fixed in material, habit, investments. Technological innovations are similar to legislative acts or political foundings, that establish a framework. The issues that divide or unite people in society are settled in the institutions and practices of policits and in tangible arrangements. 


Inherently political technologies: 

The belief that technologies are political entails the view that the adoption of a technical system brings with it conditions for human relationships that have a political cast, like decentralization.
