###Wajcman, Judy (1991): Feminism confronts technology. Ein Ãœberblick. Cambridge: Polity Press.

Preface:

In the past decades, feminism has identified men's grip on technology as an important source of their power and the lack of technical skills of women as an element of their independence. The book wants to apply a more coherent approach to gender and technology. Feminist have investigated the effects of technology on society. This technological determinism was subject to critique. Wajcman acknowledges the reverse effects in a social theory, the social shaping of technology.

1. Feminist Critiques of Science 

It is common to measure society's progress along science, technology and medicine, but the relation between science and society is currently subject to profound questioning. The feminist perspective on science is a recent endeavour, but it has attracted a lot of debate, that is parallel to the criticism about technology and gender. 

------------------------------------------

The Sexual Politics of Science 

A general concern for women's position in the professions has led to an increased interest in science. Revisiting and writing biographies have demonstrated that women have in fact made important contributions. However, the focus has shifted from exceptional women to the general patters - the limited acccess to scientific institutions, the structural barriers to women's participation, sex discrimination and channeling girls away from science or the construction of feminine identity are subject to criticism. But rather than questioning science itself, it was assumed that girls just needed the right opportunities, to become scientists. 
This approach locates the problem in women and asks them to exchange aspects of their gender identity. It doesn't ask for a broader change in institutions. For example, the hours do not allow for childcare, which men traditionally avoided. The cultural stereotype of science as linked with masculinity is also crucial. Furthermore sciences have been shaped by masculine biases, with a direction towards profit and warfare, and Marxist analysis linked it with capitalist methods and production. 
At the same time the sociology of scientific knowledge had the premise, that scientific knowledge, too, is affected by society. Gender specific accounts on this were rare. 


------------------------------------------

Scientific Knowledge as Patriarchal Knowledge. 

Concern with gender and scintific knowledge can be traced back to the women's health movement, that dealt with questions and demands around medical male practices and dominance, with a sexist bias in medical definitions of mental health, and the marginalization of female health workers. 
There has been a growing awareness of the use of female and male metaphors and dualisms. Criticsm pointed at the representation of females as passive objects and males as active agents. Some feminists celebrate this association with nature though, rejecting patriarchal science, others were heading towards a gender-neutral science. 



------------------------------------------

A science based on women's values?

Contrary to liberal feminist approaches, that saw science as gender neutral, radical feminism emphasized the differences and women's greater humanism, pacifism etc. This return to an emphasis on natural or psychological gender differences is a common thread. Essentialism is subject to criticque, as the notion of a set female nature lies at the heart of opressive conceptions. Masculinity and femininity are socially constructed and constantly under reconstruction. But there is no constant dichotomy, there is a matrix of contrasts. (Strathern). What is considered male or female differes across cultural gorups. And the qualities that some women experience as feminine, do not reflect experiences of all women, as they are divided along class, race and culture. This doesn't mean that the differences are irrelevant, gender is in almost every culture fundamentel to social organization and identity. And qualities associated with males are almost everywhere more highly regarded. Women have in common that they have been marinalized from every powerful institution. We should engage in social practices to redefine values and set the feminist spotlight not only on recruitment but also on the content of scientific knolwedge.

------------------------------------------

From Science to Technology

The debate about society and technology often takes a technic determinist stance. A major concern of women has been the impact of technology on women's lives, especially on women's work, in households or in the third work, where women are cheap labour assembling components. Lately, a debate has developed over reproductive technologies. 
There has been a tension between views that see technology as liberating women and the reverse view, that technologies are oppressive to women. A ky issue here is whether the problem lies in men's domination of technology or whether technology is in some sense inherently patriarchal. If women were in control, would there be more benign technologies? 
There is also a need to distinguish between science and technology and develop different theoretical approaches. This has been common in sociology, to see technology as applied science, while it possesses own distinct cultural resources. 
Definitions of technology see it as a body of knowledge, activities and practices and physical artifacts. However feminist perspectives on technology are more recent and less developed than those on science. 


------------------------------------------

Hidden from History

Gender is rarely mentioned in technology studies. Women's contributions have been left out, even in progressive humanist studies and journals. The history of technology depicts the inventor as male. A task of feminists therefore has been to uncover and recover the roles of women in technological developments. Due to the sources, like the patent registry, women are often not mentioned - rather their husband or the financial backers. At the same time, access to education was denied. A more radical notion sees that women, especially black women were among the first technologists, since they were responsible mostly for gathering and planting and hence it seems logical that they invented the tools and methods involved in this work, like slings, knifes, sickles or plows. Furthermore, technologies that are associated with women are often not seen technical, like the baby bottle, which has transformed human experiences tremendously. But it doesn't appear in the history of technology. 


------------------------------------------

A technology based on women's values? 

Women have asked the technology question - parallel to the science question - to explore the masculinity of technology itself. There has also been a call for technology based on women's values, also from male authors. This notion of female nature is essentialist, again, and it is important to ask how women became associated with these values, since the answers involve examining the ways women's experiences were restricted to the home and families. Nevertheless, the strength lies in going beyond the usual conception of the problem as being a women's exclusion. Feminists have pointed at all kinds of barriers but rarely has the problem been seen in the way engineering is taught. 


------------------------------------------

Technology and the division of labour 

The labour process literature's basic argument was that capitalist worker relations are a major factor affecting the technology of production in capitalism, they were deliberately designed to deskill and eliminate human labour. Technology was understood as the reult of capitalist social relations. However, this approach was gender blind because it focused exclusively on class terms. Women's exclusion was the consequence of a gender division of labour and the male domination of skills that developed under capitalism. Some argue, that before the industrial revolution, women had less barriers to acquire technical skills. The advent of machinerey challenged traditional skills, men had the monopoly over the new skills created. Male craft workers couldn't prevent women from entering production, so they organized rights over technology - women were labourers working in unskilles job for lowest pay. "It is the most damning indictment of skilled working-class men and their unions that they excluded women from membership and prevented them gaining competences that could have secured them a decent living" - Cockburn. 
By control of the key technologies men denied women practical experiences upon which they could have invented. Experience of existing technology is a precondition for the invention of new technology. 


------------------------------------------

Missing: The Gender Dimension in the Sociology of Technology

It is evident that technology is not the product of rational technical imperatives, political choices are embedded in their design and in the selection. Technological change is a process subject to struggles for control by different groups. As such, the outcomes dpeend primarily on the distribution of power and resources within society.
Sociology has moved away from studying the individual inventor, but rather show the effects of social relations on technology. The evolution is a function of a complex set of technical, social, economic and political factors. So far though, little attention has been paid to the gender interests, what studies overlook is the absence of women which is significant. Preferences for technologies are shaped by a set of social arrangements that reflect men's powe rin the wider society.
